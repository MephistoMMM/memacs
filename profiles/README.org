#+title: Doom's profile directory

This directory houses Doom's profiles (both generated or static), which in turn
will contain all "local" data for that profile, including packages, caches,
server files, and so on. It's also where generated files (like autoloads) are
written to.

This directory may serve as an alternative to =$EMACSDIR/profiles.el= for
[[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/commit/5b6b204bcbcf69d541c49ca55a2d5c3604f04dad][declaring profiles]]: each directory here is an implicit profile, so assuming
=$EMACSDIR/profiles/foo/init.el= exists, then ~emacs --profile foo~ will be
equivalent to ~emacs --init-directory $EMACSDIR/profiles/foo~.

#+begin_quote
*Warning:* Generated (or static) profiles will follow the =X@Y= naming
convention. To avoid conflicts, avoid naming any profile you put in here the
same way. For example: =default@latest=, =test@942=, =safe-mode@static=,.
