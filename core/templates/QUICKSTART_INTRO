Before you doom yourself, there are a few things you should know:

1. Whenever you edit your doom! block in ~/.doom.d/init.el or modify your
   modules, run:

     bin/doom refresh

   This will ensure all needed packages are installed, all orphaned packages are
   removed, and your autoloads files are up to date. This is important! If you
   forget to do this you will get errors!

2. If something inexplicably goes wrong, try `bin/doom doctor`

   This will diagnose common issues with your environment and setup, and may
   give you clues about what is wrong.

3. Use `bin/doom upgrade` to update Doom. Doing it any other way may require
   additional work. When in doubt, run `bin/doom refresh`.

4. Check out `bin/doom help` to see what else `bin/doom` can do (and it is
   recommended you add ~/.emacs.d/bin to your PATH).

5. You can find Doom's documentation via `M-x doom/help` or `SPC h D`.

Have fun!
