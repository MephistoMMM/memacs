# What is Doom Emacs

It is a story as old as time. A stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic as
vimmer -- envious of the features of modern text editors -- spirals into despair
before succumbing to the [dark side][url:evil-mode]. This is his config.

Doom is a configuration framework for [GNU
Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) tailored for Emacs bankruptcy
veterans who want less framework in their frameworks and the performance of a
hand rolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your own config or a
resource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite OS.

## Doom's mantras

- **Gotta go fast.** Startup and run-time performance are priorities. Doom goes
  beyond lazy loading packages by modifying them to be snappier and load lazier!
- **Close to metal.** There's less between you and vanilla Emacs by design.
  There's less to grok, on top of Emacs.
- **Readability counts.** Internals ought to be written as if reading them were
  part of the user experience, and it is! Modules should be syntactically sweet.
  Backend logic should be functional (as much as elisp permits), abstraction
  light and (hopefully) documented.
- **Opinionated, but not stubborn.** Doom is a bundle of reasonable defaults and
  curated opinions, but all of it should be optional. Use as little or as much
  of it as you like.
- **Your system, your rules.** There are more ways to set up your development
  environment than there are dislikes on Youtube Rewind '18, so Doom leaves it
  to you. Doom will not *automatically* install system dependencies (and will
  coerce its plugins not to do so either). Use `doom doctor` to figure out
  what's missing.

## Features

- Minimalistic good looks inspired by modern editors.
- A modular architecture for a more organized Emacs configuration.
- A custom elisp library to help simplify your config.
- (Optional) Vim-emulation powered by [evil-mode][url:evil-mode], including
  ports of popular vim plugins and functionality.
- A declarative [package management system][doom:packages] (powered by
  [straight.el][url:straight]) with a command line interface. Install packages
  from anywhere, not just (M)ELPA.
- A curated set of sane defaults for all packages, all (major) OSes, and Emacs
  itself.
- Support for *many* programming languages. Too many to list. Includes syntax
  highlighting, linters/checker integration, inline code evaluation, code
  completion (where possible), REPLs, documentation lookups, snippets, and more!
- Support for *many* tools, like docker, pass, ansible, terraform, and more.
- A Spacemacs-esque [keybinding scheme][doom:bindings], centered around leader
  and localleader prefix keys (<kbd>SPC</kbd> and <kbd>SPC</kbd><kbd>m</kbd>, by
  default).
- A rule-based [popup management system][doom:popups] that dictates how
  temporary or disposable buffers are displayed (and disposed of).
- Automatic indentation detection and [editorconfig][url:editorconfig]
  integration. Let someone else argue about tabs vs **\_\***spaces**\*\_**.
- Project-management tools and framework-specific minor modes with their own
  snippets libraries.
- Project search (and replace) utilities, powered by [ripgrep][url:ripgrep].
- Isolated and persistent workspaces (also substitutes for vim tabs).
- An envvar file generator that captures a snapshot of your shell environment
  for Doom to load at startup. No more struggling to get Emacs to inherit your
  `PATH`, among other things.

# Getting Help

## Community

We have [a Discord server][url:discord]! Hop on and say hi!

## Troubleshooting

Encountered strange behavior or an error? Here are some things to try before you
shoot off that bug report:

- Run `bin/doom sync`. This ensures Doom is properly set up and its autoloads
  files are up-to-date.
- If you have byte-compiled your config (with `bin/doom compile`), see if
  `bin/doom clean` makes the issue go away. Never debug issues with a
  byte-compiled config, it will make your job harder.
- Run `bin/doom doctor` to detect common issues in your development environment.
- Search Doom's issue tracker for mention of any error messages you've received.
- [Visit our FAQ][docs:faq] to see if your issue is listed.

If all else fails, [file that bug report][github:new-issue]! Please include the
behavior you've observed, the behavior you expected, and any error messages or
warnings logged to the \*Messages\* buffer (can be opened with <kbd>SPC h
e</kbd> or `M-x view-echo-area-messages`).

It's a great help if you included a backtrace with errors, i.e. `M-x
toggle-debug-on-error` then recreating the error(s).

## Contributing

Doom (and my Emacs work in general) is a labor of love and incurable madness,
done on my spare time. If you'd like to support my work, there are many things
you can do to help; I welcome any contribution!

- I love pull requests and bug reports. Check out the [Contributing
  Guidelines][docs:contributing] to find out how you can help out.
- I welcome Elisp pointers! Don't hesitate to [tell me my Elisp-fu
  sucks][github:new-issue] (but please tell me why).
- Hop on [our Discord server][url:discord] and say hi! Help others out, hang out
  or talk to me about Emacs, or gamedev, or programming, machine learning,
  physics, pixel art, anime, gaming -- anything you like. Nourish this lonely
  soul!
- If you'd like to support my work financially, consider buying me a drink
  through [liberapay][url:liberapay] or [paypal][url:paypal]. Donations are a
  great help. My work here contends with studies, ventures in indie gamedev, and
  my freelance work.
