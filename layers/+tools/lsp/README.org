* Description
This layer adds support for basic language server protocol packages speaking [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification][language server protocol]].

** Features:
- Cross references (definitions, references, document symbol, workspace symbol search and others)
- Workspace-wide symbol rename
- Symbol highlighting
- Flycheck
- Completion with =company-lsp=
- Signature help with eldoc
- Symbol documentation in a child frame (=lsp-ui-doc=)
- Each language server may support a subset of these features and may have their extension, check =M-x lsp-capabilities= in a LSP buffer and the language server's website for details.

* Configuration
The LSP ecosystem is based on two packages: [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-ui]].
Please check out their documentation.

If you add `lsp-*-enable` to major mode hooks for auto initialization of language clients, customize =lsp-project-whitelist= =lsp-project-blacklist= to disable projects you don't want to enable LSP.
