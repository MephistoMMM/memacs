* Description
This module augments Emacs' built-in undo system to be more intuitive.

** Maintainers
This module has no dedicated maintainers.

** Module Flags
+ =+tree= Uses ~undo-tree~ instead of ~undo-fu~, which is a little less stable,
  but offers branching undo history and a visualizer for navigating it.

** Plugins
+ [[https://gitlab.com/ideasman42/emacs-undo-fu][undo-fu]]
+ [[https://gitlab.com/ideasman42/emacs-undo-fu-session][undo-fu-session]]
+ [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/undo-tree][undo-tree]] (=+tree=)

** Hacks
+ Both undo-fu and undo-tree have been modified to use zstd to compress undo
  history if it is available.
+ undo-tree only
  + Text properties are stripped from undo history to shrink it.
  + Undo-tree is too chatty about saving its history files. This has be
    "silenced". i.e. It's visible in \*Messages\*, but won't appear in your
    minibuffer.
+ unfo-fu only
  + Doom defines =undo-fu-mode= to make it easier to add hooks/mode-local
    keybinds.
